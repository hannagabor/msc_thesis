I would like to thank my supervisor, Kristóf Bérczi, for advising me this topic
and most of all for all his encouragement and enthusiasm. I am especially grateful for the many hours
he spent with me thinking about mathematics, I really enjoyed these sessions.\\
I am also grateful for Péter Madarasi for his useful suggestions.
