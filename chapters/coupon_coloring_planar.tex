From now on we will focus on $2$-coupon colorings and planar graphs.

\section{Introducing the Goddard-Henning conjecture}

A conjecture of Goddard and Henning is the following.

\begin{conj}
  If $G$ is a simple triangulated planar graph of order at least $4$, then the
  total domatic number of $G$ is at least $2$.
\end{conj}

\begin{remark}
  The simplicity of the graph is necessary. Suppose the graph on figure
  \ref{fig:parallel} has a $2$-coupon coloring. Then $A$ and $C$ must have
  different colors, because they are the only neighbors of $B$. Similarly, $C$
  and $E$ must have different colors, as well as $E$ and $A$. That is a
  contradiction, since $A$, $C$ and $E$ form a triangular.
\end{remark}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=70mm]{parallel}
  \caption{Simplicity is necessary}
  \label{fig:parallel}
\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
  Allowing triangulated disks (i.e. planar graphs with at most one face greater
  than $3$), the conjecture does not hold. For example, the graph on figure
  \ref{fig:sungraph} does not have a $2$-coupon coloring from similar reasons as
  the previous one. We will show later that this graph is a member of a bigger
  graph family without $2$ disjoint dominating sets.
\end{remark}

  \label{fig:sungraph}
\end{figure}

There are some sufficient conditions known for having a total domatic number of
at least $2$. We will cover some of them along the way.
The first example is a graph family for which an easy induction shows that they
are $2$-coupon colorable.

\begin{definition}
  A graph is called a stacked graph if it can be constructed from a triangle by
  repeatedly putting a new vertex in a face and connecting it with the vertices on
  the boundary of that face.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Stacked graphs are triangulated.
\end{remark}
\begin{claim}
  Stacked graphs with at least $4$ vertices are $2$-coupon colorable.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  We can determine the colors of the vertices as the graph is constructed. The
  current coloring will maintain two following two properties.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item It is a $2$-coupon coloring of the current graph.
    \item Every face has vertices from both color classes.
  \end{enumerate}
  The construction of the graph starts with a simple triangle. Color two vertices
  of the triangle to black, and the remaining vertex to white. Color the vertex added
  to the graph in the first step to white. This coloring has the desired properties.
  When a vertex is inserted into a face, color the new vertex to white, if there is
  only one white vertex on the face's boundary, and black otherwise. This trivially
  maintains the desired properties.
\end{proof}

Goddard and Henning established the conjecture for a few cases.

\begin{claim} \label{c:odd}
  Let $G$ be a a simple triangulated graph. If all the
  vertices of $G$ have an odd degree, then there exists a coupon coloring with $2$ colors.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  There exists a proper $4$-coloring of the vertices. As every vertex $v$ has an
  odd degree, there exists an odd circle in the neighborhood of $v$. Hence, in a proper
  $4$-coloring $v$ has neighbors from at least $3$ color classes. This means that
  the union of any two color classes forms a total dominating set.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  If $G$ can be obtained from a triangulated graph $H$ by putting a new vertex on every
  face and connecting them with the vertices of that face, then $G$ it $2$-coupon
  colorable.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Take a proper $4$-coloring on the vertices of $H$ and define a $2$-coloring by taking
  the union of $2-2$ color classes. The obtained coloring has the property that
  none of the faces is monochromatic. Color the added vertices to black if the face
  has only one black vertex, and color it to white otherwise.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  Let $G$ be a a simple triangulated graph of order at least $4$. If the dual
  of $G$ is Hamiltonian, then $G$ admits two disjoint total dominating sets.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Let $C$ be the Hamiltonian graph in the dual graph. Color the vertices of $G$
  inside $C$ to black, and the vertices outside of $C$ to white.
\end{proof}

\section{Outerplanar and Hamiltonian graphs}
Zoltán Lóránt Nagy showed that the conjecture of Goddard and Henning holds for
Hamiltonian graphs. For this, he characterized the $2$-coupon colorable
maximal outerplanar graphs.

\begin{definition}
   A graph is outerplanar if it has a planar drawing for which all vertices
   belong to the outer face. A maximal outerplanar graph is an outerplanar graph
   such that adding any edge results in a not outerplanar graphs.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Te outer face of a maximal outerplanar graph is a Hamiltonian cycle.
\end{remark}

In order to provide the mentioned characterization we need to introduce a few
notions first.
\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a maximal outerplanar graph of order $n \ge 3$. The $M(G)$ sun graph
  of $G$ is obtained by gluing a triangle to each edge of the outer face.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  $M(G)$ is a maximal outerplanar graph with $2n$ vertices, from which $n$ has
  degree $2$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  If $G$ has an odd number of vertices, then $M(G)$ does not have two disjoint
  total dominating sets, as in a $2$-coupon coloring of $M(G)$, the vertices of
  $G$ must have alternating colors. The graph on figure $\ref{fig:sungraph}$ is
  the sun graph of the $BDE$ triangle. 
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
  A vertex $v$ of a maximal outerplanar graph is called a central vertex if the
  following $3$ conditions hold.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $deg(v) \ge 3$
    \item Every neighbor of $v$ has degree at least $3$
    \item For every $u, w$ neighbors of $v$ the length of the $uw$ path on the
    outer face not containing $v$ is divisible by $4$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{claim}
  The outer face of a maximal outerplanar graph does not contain two consecutive
  central vertices.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose there exists an $uv$ edge on the outer face such that $u$ and $v$ are
  central vertices. Because of the maximality of the graph there exists a $uvw$
  triangle. Index the vertices along the outer face form $v = v_1$ to $u = v_{n}$.
  Suppose $w = v_i$. From the centrality of $v$ follows that $i \equiv 2\
  (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$. On the other hand $u$ is also a central vertex, hence
  $i \equiv 1\ (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  A generalized sun graph is a maximal outerplanar graph of order
  $n \equiv 2\ (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$ such that the number of
  degree $2$ vertices plus the number of central vertices is $n/2$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Every second vertex of the outer face in a generalized sun graph is either
  central or has degree $2$.
\end{remark}

The key characterization theorem is the following.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:outerplanar}
  Let $G$ be a maximal outerplanar graph. $G$ admits $2$ disjoint total dominating
  sets if and only if $G$ is not a generalized sun graph.
\end{thm}

For proving this theorem we need some observations about generalized sun graphs.
TODO

\begin{lemma}
  The outer face of a maximal outerplanar graph has a chord TODO
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:outerplanar}]
  First we show that generalized sun graphs do not have $2$ disjoint total
  dominating sets. The proof goes by induction on the $n = 4k + 2$ number of vertices.

  For $k = 1$ there is only one generalized sun graph and it does not admit $2$
  disjoint total dominating sets. (Shown on figure \ref{fig:sungraph}.)

  Suppose $k \ge 2$ and $G$ is a generalized sun graph of order $4k + 2$. Index
  the vertices along the outer face from $v_1$ to $v_{4k + 2}$, such that every
  vertex with an odd index is central or has degree $2$. Let $c$ be a $2$-coloring of
  the graph. We show that $c$ cannot be a $2$-coupon coloring. The cardinality of the
  vertices implies that there must be two consecutive vertices $v_{2i}$ and $v_{2i + 2}$
  with the same color (say white). If $v_{2i}$ has only white neighbors, then this
  coloring is not a $2$-coupon coloring. So suppose $v_{2i}$ has a black neighbor
  $v_j$. In this case, $v_{2i}$ is a central vertex. The $v_{2i}v_j$ edge cuts the graph
  into two parts ($v_{2i}v_j$ is an edge in both graphs). Both of
  these graphs are generalized sun graphs, as $v_{2i}$ either remains a central
  vertex or become a vertex of degree $2$ in these smaller graphs, whereas other
  central vertices remain central vertices. By induction, the restriction of
  $c$ is not a $2$-coupon coloring in either of the smaller graphs. If there is
  a vertex $v_l$ with a monochromatic neighborhood in one of the smaller graphs
  and $l \neq 2i, l \neq j$, then $v_l$ has the same neighborhood in $G$, hence
  all its neighbors are from the same color class. $v_{2i}$ cannot violate the
  condition, as it was chosen in a way that it has both a black and a white neighbor
  in both graphs. Thus the only remaining case is when $v_j$ has a monochromatic
  neighborhood in both graphs. But in this case, all of its neighbors are from
  the same color class as $v_{2i}$, so it has a monochromatic neighborhood also
  in $G$.

  \vspace{0.4cm}

  Now we show that if a graph $G$ of order $n$ is not a generalized sun graph
  then it does have $2$ disjoint total dominating sets.

  If $n \equiv 0\ (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$, then it is easy to find a $2$-coupon coloring:
  color the vertices along the boundary of the outer face by repeating the pattern
  $BBWW$.

  If $n \equiv 1\ (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$, then the same coloring method works, if you
  start the coloring from the right vertex. By lemma \ref{lem:two_chord} there
  exists a chord $uv$ of length $2$. Alternating colors in pairs starting from $v$
  does the job.

  \end{figure}

  If $n \equiv 3\ (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$, then start the coloring from a vertex next
  to $v$.

    \includegraphics[width=50mm]{4k+3}
    \caption{Coloring an outerplanar graph of order $4k + 3$}
    \label{fig:4k+3}
  \end{figure}

  Suppose $n \equiv 2\ (\textrm{mod}\ 4)$. We show that if $G$ does not have $2$
  disjoint total dominating sets, then it is a generalized sun graph.

  TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  With a slight modification of the proof it can be shown that the vertices of a
  generalized sun graph cannot be colored in a way that every degree $2$ or central
  vertex has neighbors from both color classes.
\end{remark}

\begin{thm}
  Every triangulated graph with a Hamiltonian circle admits $2$ disjoint
  dominating sets.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a triangulated Hamiltonian graph and let $n$ denote the number of
  vertices in $G$.
